## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

Displaying the featured items twice. First using Grid and second using Flex.

### What I learned

I much prefer the simplicity of Grid although when I completed the challenge on my own, I used Flex. The Grid solution is far cleaner and I learnt how to use grid-template-areas to position the cards correctly in the desktop view.
